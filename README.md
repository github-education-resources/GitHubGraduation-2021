Swag has shipped! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Keep an eye out for something fun in the mail. If you live in the United States, this means anytime from today through next week. If you live internationally, expect 3-4 weeks for shipments to arrive.

If you have not received your swag by **January 31, 2022**, head back to this repository and we'll open a new form to replace lost or damaged shipments.

Happy coding 💖

First off, THANK YOU 🙌 all for your patience. Production and shipping around the world are still quite delayed, but we are getting closer. We are 3-weeks away from finishing printing trading cards. Once printed, we'll work hard to get everything into envelopes and shipped straight to you 💌. For international shipments, this can mean 2-3 additional weeks. Anyone in the United States can expect something in the mail within a week after printing.

If you need to update your shipping information, we can for three more weeks. Please [submit your updated address in the Notes section](https://airtable.com/shrZuXu2OKrxO6PiD) of the question form.

Congrats again on your graduation 💖

If you believe there has been a mistake with reviews, please [let us know in an Issue](https://github.com/education/GitHubGraduation-2021/issues). All Issues will be responded to before the event on June 5.
Don’t forget to [save the date](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20210605T160000Z%2F20210605T180000Z&text=GitHub%20Graduation%202021%20%F0%9F%8E%93&location=twitch.tv%2Fgithubeducation&details=Join%20us%20on%20GitHub%20Campus%20TV%20to%20%22walk%20the%20stage%22%20and%20celebrate%20the%20accomplishments%20of%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20graduating%20class%20with%20your%20fellow%20developers.%20) and [follow us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation) for notifications!

### May 14, 2021

Hi Octograds!

You all have made our week with your messages, pull requests, and support for each other 💖 We are honored to be a part of your graduation experience.

We have merged 5,000 pull requests and swag eligibility is now closed. If your pull request is merged as of today (May 14), we will send you a custom holographic trading card in the mail. Please have patience. Swag production and shipping takes time and we will post updates to this repository as we have them. It is unlikely you will receive a shipment before the event. 

In the meantime, be sure to update your GitHub profile image and bio! We will use both to create your custom card. 

Our team is offline this weekend and will be back, on Monday (PT), to review pull requests to join the yearbook and "walk" the stage at GitHub Graduation on June 5. Pull requests are no longer eligible for swag but we would love to have you a part of the ceremony🎓! We will review all pull requests submitted before May 27 at 12:00pm PT (May 28 at 12:30am IT) to join the event.

Think there was a mistake? [Send us a link to any relevant pull requests and Issues](https://airtable.com/shrZuXu2OKrxO6PiD), along with a description of events. This does not include pull requests accidentally closed and recreated at a later time, or pull requests not eligible for merge before May 14 at 5:52pm PT (when the 5,000th pull request was merged). Use this form only for scenarios where you believe our bot or team made a mistake.

**Looking for more ways to support the Class of 2021? Here are a few ideas:**

👩‍💻 Continue providing feedback on pull requests to help your classmates get their pull request ready to merge. We appreciate your help and love seeing the magic of social coding.

✍️ [Share your message to a teacher or educator](https://github.com/education/GitHubGraduation-2021/files/6448974/GitHub.Graduation.Teacher.Video.Project.pdf) who has supported your journey as a student. Note: these submissions no longer qualify for swag but we would love to hear your stories nonetheless!

📪 Have patience. Our team is working hard to get through your pull requests and provide everyone with the feedback needed to join the event. GitHub Actions saved our team an enormous amount of time managing reviews this year but, as much as we love our automations, this is still a manual process to ensure the Code of Conduct is followed and the event can be enjoyed by all.

We can’t wait to see you “on stage” June 5! [Follow us on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation) for notification and [save the date](http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&dates=20210605T160000Z%2F20210605T180000Z&text=GitHub%20Graduation%202021%20%F0%9F%8E%93&location=twitch.tv%2Fgithubeducation&details=Join%20us%20on%20GitHub%20Campus%20TV%20to%20%22walk%20the%20stage%22%20and%20celebrate%20the%20accomplishments%20of%20this%20year%E2%80%99s%20graduating%20class%20with%20your%20fellow%20developers.%20). In the words of @juanpflores, let’s make this AWESOME.

❤️  @elisemoe + GitHub Education
